      CompanyList ## Reason for making this sheet 🤔 A few months ago when I was
      desperately looking for an internship, a friend of mine suggested me to
      create a company list and start cold emailing the recruiters of those
      companies. So, I created a doc and gathered all the information about the
      product based companies that hire for Software Engineering roles. Things
      did change for me after this sheet. I was able to interview with various
      companies like Yellow Messenger, Spyne AI, Netomi, and recieved test link
      for companies such as Cred, Sharechat, American Express, and so on. Even
      if you don't get the opportunity, you will have a solid network of
      recruiters. ## How to contact the recruiter 🗣 Suppose you want to connect
      with recruiters of Sharechat so these are steps which I used to follow:
      <ol>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Search Recruiter/Talent Acquistion/HR on linkedIn with the company tag
          as Sharechat 👀
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Send them a personal invite with a message that I am looking for
          opportunities as an XYZ Intern and would love to talk about open roles
          with you 💬
        </li>
        <li> If possible then send them en email wih your resume 📧</li>
        <li> Repeat the above 2 steps with atleast 5-10 recruiters 🔁 </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Wait for them to accept your request and then talk to them about open
          roles. You just need a reply from one recruiter 😎
        </li>
      </ol>
